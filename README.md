# BezierSV
I am bored and wanted to make my own sv tool, so i did this. gtk is fucked so please let me know if i did anything wrong
Please use this in conjunction with something like https://www.desmos.com/calculator/d1ofwre0fr to get a visualizaton of what is going on. I plan to try and include a visualizer sometime in the future.
